# cis343-project4-pygame

Simple Frogger implementation in Python. This only implements the first level of Frogger (i.e frogger does not get new enemies if he completes a level).

Player class implements all logic for Frogger. It inherits from the Units class.

Enemies class implements all logic for the enemies (cars, disappearing turtles). It inherits from the Units class.

Units class implements all common logic between Frogger and enemies (moving).
